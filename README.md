# nginx-handbook-projects

![...](./nginx-handbook-github.png)

This repository holds the code for my NGINX Handbook article on [__freeCodecamp__](https://freecodecamp.org). In the article the readers work through __four__ demo projects meant to explain a single use case of NGINX. These projects are as follows:

- static-demo - A demo static server.
- node-js-demo - A demo server powered by Node.js.
- php-demo - A demo server powered by PHP.
- load-balancer-demo - A demo containing three Node.js powered servers acting as a cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the Linux terminal and common Unix programs such as `ls`, `cat`, `ps`, `grep`, `find`, `nproc`, `ulimit` and `nano`.
- A computer powerful enough to run a virtual machine or a $5 virtual private server.
- Understanding of web applications and a programming language such as JavaScript or PHP.

It's fine if you haven't worked with JavaScript or PHP that much. Having a basic knowledge of executing scripts with them will suffice.
